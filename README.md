	With the advent of touch screen smart phones, human lives have never been the same. Nowadays, smart phones have become powerful tools that can connect to the internet using either second Generation (2G) or third Generation (3G) network to receive information, use the Global Positioning System (GPS) satellites to get directions and use Bluetooth to transfer files. Bluetooth 3.0 is the most widely installed module for cell phones and Personal Computers (PC) today. Home Theatre Personal Computer (HTPC) is slowly in the rise. HTPC are PCs that are connected to a Television (TV) or projector as a display. Many laptop users have started connecting their laptops to a TV.
	The proposed system ensures Bluetooth control of the PC using a mobile phone using the Android Operating System. This system avoids the use of 3G and Wireless Fidelity (Wi-Fi). It will emulate a mouse, a keyboard and a simple joystick. It allows us to control the computer within a 6 meter range.
